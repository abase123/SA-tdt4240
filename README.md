The name of our application is “Quizz Battle”, which is a game that allows players to log in and participate in 
daily quizzes at their convenience. The daily quizzes are fixed with different themes and difficulties, which will 
vary from day to day. Every day players are able to participate in the same quizzes, then view their own and global 
scores on a leaderboard. The daily quiz will be an asynchronous activity, meaning each player can take the quiz when 
they wish to, regardless of their schedules. By doing well over time, a player will be able to climb the leaderboards 
by collecting points.
